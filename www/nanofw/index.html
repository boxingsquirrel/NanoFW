NanoFW is an (early) tool to mess with the firmware for the sixth generation iPod Nano (2010).
<br>
It allows you to extract the contents (including creating a mountable resource partition image) and view information about the various .fw files.

Mac only for now, <a href="NanoFW.zip">download</a>.
